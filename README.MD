# TRM in games
Attempting to train a TRM on various games, most likely from google-deepmind's [Game Arena](https://github.com/google-deepmind/game_arena).

## ToDos:
1. Decide on a game. It must be turn-based, with text-based input/output (or easily convertible to such).
2. Decide on environment/framework. Could be game-arena mentioned above, but I'm also considering Unity ML Agents or simply writing the game myself.
3. Implement reinforcement learning / gym-like system.
4. Write training setup for TRM
5. Package to image
6. Debug the whole shit
7. Train it!

## Alternative considerations:
1. Move more towards computer vision and/or SLAM. Visual seems nice for me, since I respond strongly to it. 
2. How about video analysis? 
3. "Strategic AI": natural language -> symbols -Y symbolic reasoning engine -> LLM -> natural language
4. Analyse movies and predict the plot. 
5. "Acoustic AI" -> generate what, exactly?
6.
